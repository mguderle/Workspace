<p class=MsoNormal><b>B. Provision of the website and creation of log files</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
Every time the website is accessed, our server and applications automatically collect data and information from the computer system of the calling computer. </br>
The following data will be collected temporarily: </br>
</br>
•	Date of access </br>
•	Name of the operating system installed on the accessing device </br>
•	Name of the browser used </br>
•	Source system used for access </br>
•	The IP address of the accessing device </br>
</br>
The data is stored in the log files of our systems. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.</br>
The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 § 1 lit. f GDPR. The data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data serves us to optimize the websites, to eliminate malfunctions and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. 
Pursuant to Art. 6 § 1 lit. f GDPR, our legitimate interest in data processing also lies in these purposes. The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, 
this is the case when the respective session has ended. If the data is stored in log files, this is the case after nine days at the latest.
</br>
</br>
The collection of the data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user.

<p class=MsoNormal><b>D. Registration</b></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
On our websites we offer users the possibility to register by entering personal data via an input mask. As a rule, we collect your e-mail address, surname and first name. We will inform you about the specific processing of your data as part of the registration process and obtain your consent. 
In addition, reference is made to this data protection declaration.</br>
The legal basis for the processing of data is Art. 6 § 1 lit. a GDPR if the user has given his consent. If registration serves the fulfilment of a contract to which the user is a party or the implementation of pre-contractual measures, the additional legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 § 1 lit. b GDPR. 
A registration of the user is necessary for the provision of certain contents and services on our website or for the fulfilment of a contract with the user or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. 
This is the case for the data collected during the registration process if the registration on our websites is cancelled or changed. This is the case for the registration process to fulfill a contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures if the data is no longer required for the execution of the contract. 
Even after conclusion of the contract, it may still be necessary to store personal data of the contractual partner in order to fulfil contractual or legal obligations.</br>
As a user you have the possibility to cancel the registration at any time. You can change the data stored about you at any time; the procedure is described in more detail in the specific registration process. If the data is required to fulfill a contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, premature deletion of the data is only possible insofar as there are no contractual or statutory obligations to the contrary.
